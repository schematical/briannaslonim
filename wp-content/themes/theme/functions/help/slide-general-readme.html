<h2>What are "Slides"?</h2>
<p>A slide appears only on the homepage. You can customize the layout,
choose a featured image, video or quote and add a Call to Action Button.
You can stack several Slides on your Homepage to feature products, stories, videos and more.
To reorder your Slides navigate to <b>Slides > Reorder</b> and drop and drag them as you'd like them to appear.</p>
